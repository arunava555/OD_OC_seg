We are releasing a Matlab code for segmentation of the Optic Disc and Cup in retinal color fundus images.
The code is freely available to allow other researchers to develop, compare and benchmark their algorithms. 
This code is not clinically approved and released for non-commerical research purposes only.

The code is primarily based on the following papers. Please cite them if you find the code useful.
